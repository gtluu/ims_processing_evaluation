# Evaluation of data analysis platforms and compatibility with MALDI-TOF imaging mass spectrometry datasets

R code for processing done using Cardinal on <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i> PA14 imaging mass spectrometry data sets. Cardinal 2.4.0.9000, a forked branch of [Cardinal MSI](https://github.com/kuwisdelu/Cardinal) with several pending bug fixes, can be found [here](https://github.com/gtluu/Cardinal/tree/v2.4.0.9000). Discussion with the developer regarding the bug fixes in Cardinal 2.4.0.9000 is currently ongoing and will be updated on this page. Custom in-house functions used during analysis can be found in the [cardinalscripts](https://github.com/gtluu/cardinalscripts) repository.
